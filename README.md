# TodoApp
The project is a RESTful web service built using Spring Boot that provides backend functionality for managing todos. It exposes various RESTful endpoints to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on todo entities. These endpoints interact with a database through a service layer to retrieve, create, update, and delete todo items.

Key Components:

RestController: The TodoController class acts as a REST controller, defining endpoints for handling HTTP requests related to todos. It receives requests, delegates the processing to the service layer, and returns appropriate responses.

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) Configuration: The @CrossOrigin annotation is used to enable CORS for the specified origin (http://localhost:3000). This allows frontend applications from that origin to access the backend APIs.

Request Mapping: Endpoints are mapped to specific HTTP methods and URIs using annotations such as @GetMapping, @PostMapping, @PutMapping, and @DeleteMapping. These annotations define the URL patterns for accessing todo-related resources.

Request Parameters: Path variables (@PathVariable) are used to extract dynamic values from the URI, such as the username and id in the endpoint URLs. These parameters are used to identify specific todos or user-specific todo lists.

Response Handling: The ResponseEntity class is used to build HTTP responses with appropriate status codes and data. It allows for flexible handling of response bodies, headers, and status codes based on the outcome of the request processing.

Autowired Service: The TodoService is injected into the controller using the @Autowired annotation. This service layer encapsulates business logic related to todo management, such as retrieving todos from the database, performing CRUD operations, and applying business rules.

Frontend Integration:

For the frontend, a React application can consume these RESTful APIs to build a user interface for managing todos. The frontend can send HTTP requests to the backend endpoints defined in the TodoController to fetch, create, update, or delete todos. It can display todo lists, allow users to add new todos, mark todos as completed, and delete todos.

Conclusion:

The project provides a robust backend implementation for managing todos through RESTful APIs. It can be seamlessly integrated with a React frontend to create a full-fledged todo management application, allowing users to interact with their todos in a user-friendly manner.
